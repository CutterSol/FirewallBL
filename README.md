This list can be added to an Asus router running Merlin via AMTM in the Skynet app.  I initially add anything I am testing via the "fast switch" option of the Skynet settings first.  Then if you have a list you like better than the default for Skynet you can update the default Skynet list with that list.  This list is actually a lists of list, when Skynet does it's update it will check for updates to each of thse list--they are dynamic and change typically daily.
